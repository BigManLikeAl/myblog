    <h1>Welcome To My Blog<h1>  
 <h2> About me</h2>
<p>My name is Ali Mansur. I am 24 years old. I am from the Yemen. I have 5 brothers and 5 sisters not including me. Before I came to England I was living in Holland as a kid. Then grew up in Greater Manchester most of my life. Before Code Nation I did courses at alot of colleges studying Uniformed Public Services with hopwood Hall College, I did Bricklaying in School, I was Learning Mechanics with YMCA when I left scool. I have done Plumbing and Mental Health Awareness at Bury College. What I put in my mind set is that I can always achieve if I persist and try and try again.</p>

<h2> Why I decide to come Code Nation and my experience so far</h2>
<p>Why I decided to come to Code Nation was that I was searching online for courses and then I ended up finding the course information online about Cyber Security and Coding. So I put my details including email and contact number. Code Nation contacted me to have a look at the school. I was interested in Code Nation. So they put me on the Develop Coding course.  My experience with Code Nation was brilliant. I like my tutor Liam he is  a fantastic tutor to have. I have learnt a lot from him. Since I started studying with Code Nation. I have decided I want to get in the IT industry either Cyber Security or Coding because I really enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
<p>Modern business need IT because nowadays mostly everything we use in businesses needs technology, security system for businesses and it needs coders to do this. It lets the computer system know what to do e.g. with Card Payments, Tills and etc.
